# PyStock
PyStock is a Python program I made in my free time instead of being with my families, this program fetch stock's price
from [finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io)'s API, then display it to you.  
The code is indeed real mess but at least it helps me remember Python again because my past Python knowledge is buried
thanks to JavaScript.
## How to use
Step One: Download required dependencies:
- `requests`

Step Two: Go to `stock.py`, take a look at line 4 and change the value of `fh_token` with the API key you got from
[finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io).  
Step Three: Run it with either
- `python stock.py [STOCK_SYMBOL]`
- `python stock.py`, then fills the prompt with the stock symbol.
